# LiveSplitX

This is a project of mine to port [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit) to .Net 5 so it can be run anywhere. 

My plan is to start with a brand new project and copy things over one piece at a time.

I've decided to use [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/) as the cross platform UI because it seems to be the most functional at this point.
